[+] Summary: This research introduces a new class of post-exploitation intelligence modules for the Metasploit Framework. Unlike traditional modules, these components do
             not exploit vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, or modify target systems.
             The modules operate as a contextual intelligence layer that analyzes environment sensitivity, misconfiguration meaning, privilege escalation feasibility
             (prediction only), and detection risk before any intrusive action is taken.
           
[+] This work defines a previously non-existent category in offensive security:

Context-Aware Post-Exploitation Intelligence.

[+] Vendor: Rapid7 – Metasploit Framework (Extension Layer)

[+] Product: Metasploit Framework – Post-Exploitation Intelligence Modules

[+] Severity: Informational / Research

[+] Risk Level: None (Non-Intrusive Analysis Only)

[+] Modules:

- Environment Intelligence
- Misconfiguration Context Scanner
- Privilege Escalation Predictor
- Scoring & Confidence Engine
- Decision Intelligence Reporter

[+] Impact:

- No exploitation performed
- No privilege modification
- No persistence
- No filesystem changes
- No interaction with Metasploit core components

These modules cannot damage Metasploit or target systems.

[+] Module Path: modules/post/intelligence/

[+] Usage: cp -r post/intelligence/ $MSF_PATH/modules/post/

msfconsole
use post/intelligence/environment_context
set SESSION <id>
run

[+] Disclosure Timeline: 2026-01-23 - Public Release

[+] Notes:

This project is intended for research, training, and decision-support purposes.
It is safer than traditional post-exploitation techniques and encourages
operational abstinence when risk outweighs benefit.

[+] Affected Systems:

- Any system supported by Metasploit sessions
- No OS-specific dependency
- Read-only interaction

[+] Module Descriptions:

1. Environment Intelligence

[+] Purpose: Identifies the operational role of the compromised system (workstation, server,production, testing).

[+] Benefit: Prevents high-risk actions on sensitive or regulated environments.

[+] Path: post/intelligence/environment_context.rb

2. Misconfiguration Context Scanner

[+] Purpose: Analyzes weak configurations and interprets their real impact, not just their presence.

[+] Benefit: Eliminates false positives and meaningless findings.

[+] Path: post/intelligence/misconfiguration_context.rb

3. Privilege Escalation Predictor

[+] Purpose: Estimates the probabi : lity of successful privilege escalation without exploiting anything.

[+] Benefit: Reduces failed attempts and detection risk.

[+] Path:post/intelligence/privesc_predictor.rb

4. Scoring & Confidence Engine

[+] Purpose: Converts raw indicators into measurable risk and confidence scores.

[+] Benefit: Transforms technical data into executive-level insight.

[+] Path: post/intelligence/scoring_engine.rb

5. Decision Intelligence Reporter

[+] Purpose: Produces a final human-readable intelligence report.

[+] Benefit: Supports go / no-go decisions.

[+] Path: post/intelligence/intelligence_reporter.rb

[+] Security Impact:

- No exploitation
- No persistence
- No privilege modification
- No file system changes
- No Metasploit core interaction

[+] Ethical & Legal Considerations:

Designed for research and decision support.
Suitable for red, blue, and purple teams.
Safer than traditional post-exploitation modules.
Encourages action abstinence when risk outweighs benefit.

[+] Classification:

- Research Tool
- Decision Support System
- Offensive Intelligence Layer

This work is not classified as an exploit or vulnerability disclosure.
