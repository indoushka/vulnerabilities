[+] References : https://packetstorm.news/files/id/214652/ & 	CVE-2026-1504

[+] Summary    : a theoretical trigger simulation for a Chromium-class vulnerability associated with memory corruption scenarios commonly affecting the V8 JavaScript engine or the Blink rendering engine.
                 The code intentionally performs heap allocation patterns and unsafe memory access attempts in order to observe browser stability, crash behavior, or exception handling, as typically analyzed during vulnerability research.
				 No real exploit logic, sandbox escape, or code execution is implemented.
                 This PoC does not claim the existence of a working vulnerability, nor does it exploit any confirmed flaw in Chromium. 
				 It is provided strictly for educational, testing, and defensive research purposes, illustrating how memory corruption conditions are conceptually triggered during browser security analysis.
