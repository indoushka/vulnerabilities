POC :

[+] A non-destructive PHP scanning tool for audio codes (named: AudioCodes Scanner - PHP).

[+] What the tool includes:

    An HTML + AJAX interface with RTL font.

[+] Safe scanning only:

    GET/HEAD requests for common paths (including those in https://packetstorm.news/files/id/211819/) without sending any exploit payloads.

    Reveals the phpinfo page if it exists, and extracts the server headers and a short text snippet.

    Exports results to CSV and TXT formats ready for use.

    Central PHP code that makes the requests using cURL (or fallback to file_get_contents if unavailable).

[+] Usage instructions:

    Run the web interface and enter the address in the format host:port or http://host:port.

    Review the results, and download the CSV file for documentation or to send to your system administrator.

[+] Security and Responsibility Notes:

    This tool does not exploit vulnerabilities—its purpose is solely to scan for and document exposures.

    For any actual exploit or penetration testing, you must have explicit permission from the system owner.
